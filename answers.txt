• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
 If you create a file in your repository named .gitignore, Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, 
 before you make a commit. A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules 
 with any other users that clone the repository. For a java project it should include all the files u dnt want to keep in
 github for version control - like .zip, .rar, .jar, .class etc and it should allow .java files to upload to github.

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
 Fast-Forward in git means that a pull/rebase was able to update directly to the new revision without having to perform any merges.
 It means, when you pull, you are pulling only new commits. No merges, no conflicts, everything is clean. This happens when no changes
 have been committed locally since the last pull.

• Why should you have different branches?
 When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time 
 – some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.When you create
 a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't
 affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be 
 merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.



• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
 I think we usually should have 1 repository per project as It works better with the development workflow e.g When you discover
 you messed up something after several commits, it's much easier to fix when it's just one project. Just think about, you did 
 commits to two other projects and now you need to fix the commit you did on the 3rd project.
